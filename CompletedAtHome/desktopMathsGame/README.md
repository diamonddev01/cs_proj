# DesktopMathsGame
**~/CompletedAtHome/desktopMathsGame**
### Origin
Saw TK inter and did a CI version of this game as a challenge in school and decided that I wanted to make it into a full game, clearly had way too much fun on this idea.

### Code
- [main.py](./main.py)
  - Primary code file, contains all the code to run tkinter and 90% of the code
- [database.py](./database.py)
  - Added this to interact with the CSV file. Could be removed but I like it as is
- [Config.py](./Config.py)
  - Holds the configuration for the project.
- [Results.csv](./Results.csv)
  - Holds all your results in a database. Included it for simplicity.
- [README.md](./README.md)
  - This file :)

### Uses
- tkinter - Desktop application framework
- random - Needed some numbers
- math - To compute the size of the multiverse
